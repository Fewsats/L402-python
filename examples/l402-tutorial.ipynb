    "\n",
    "### 1. Invoice Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invoice Creation:** An invoice is generated specifying the amount, currency, and a description that ties it to the specific content access request. This ensures that the payment is directly linked to the content being accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoding Payment Request:** The invoice is encoded into a `payment_request` string. This string is a compact, URL-safe format that can be easily transmitted and handled by payment systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linking to Macaroon:** The `payment_hash` generated during the invoice creation is used in the macaroon's identifier. This establishes a secure link between the payment and the authorization token, ensuring that each payment corresponds to a specific access permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transmission Preparation:** The `payment_request` is prepared for transmission alongside the macaroon, enabling the client to make a payment directly related to the resource they wish to access.\n",
